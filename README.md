Resume-Ranker
=============

**Abstract**

The project “Resume Ranker” aims to simplify the shortlisting phase during
recruitment. As the number of applicants for any job vacancy soars up, it
becomes an extremely tedious task for the HRs to shortlist the profiles on the
basis of CVs. Moreover, the view-time of a CV in those cases is reduced to
as low as 15-20 seconds. This enhances chances of rejection of a deserving
candidate.

Further, from the students' point of view, it is always beneficial to test the
depth of waters before diving. Through this website, the students will be able
to judge the level of their technical proficiency as per the industry standards
and brush up their skills accordingly. In this way, the project serves a two-
way purpose for both the students and the recruiters.
